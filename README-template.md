# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding. 

I didn't change the file structure much from what I got from Frontend Mentor. 

I did move my CSS to a file called myStyles.css, but other than that it's the same. 

Download, check out the index.html and myStyles.css files and let me know what you think!
